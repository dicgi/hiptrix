This repository is a lab for experiments using [Houdini FX](https://www.sidefx.com/products/houdini-fx/).

I can't say I'm a _houdini guy_ because, talking about the software, I'm not a specialist. Therefore, the purpose of this repository is to develop a laboratory for knowledge and ideas. I'll be really happy if something here can be useful for somebody. Feel free to send me a message if you have any doubt. I'll do my best to be helpful.

Furthermore, you can access the [Wiki](https://bitbucket.org/diegodci/hiptrix/wiki/Home) for more infos.
