In this [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_3D_test_models) you can find a relation of a lot of common 3D test models.

## Standard test images

In this [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_test_image) you can find a huge relation of common test images for _image processing_ and _computer graphics_.
